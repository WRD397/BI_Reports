> ### 3. Online Retail Store
This analysis was done to mainly focus on 4 to 5 key objectives. 
* One was to understand the revenue scenario. The region dependencies of the total revenue so that the higher executives get an idea about the highest revenue generating countries. This clearly tells that the people here simply demand the products the store selling, so may be openning offline stores or other verticals here would be a good decision. Also, what are the regions that need more marketting and promotion, are also visible in the same analysis.
* This also tells a lot about the customer base. The customers which are generating most revenues and also, the customer base which is most loyal to the company. It gives an proper visual if any of the customers falls in both category or not. The highest revenue generating customers can be pushed with high value products in a more frequent manner as well as they can be pushed subscription plans along with special discounts so that they dont churn at any cost.
* This also focuses on the stocks and it's contributions to the total revenue. This portrays the current market trends and the demands. On the basis of this, the higher executives can plan accordingly to maintain the availability of those products at store.
